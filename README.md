Dusk Esports Project


After finishing the project I have the following critisms;

- Needs comments
- code while relatively clean and somewhat segmented, could use compartmentalisation into seperate files.
- Database file is shit. Could be rewritten to make it less confusing at a glance. This is a result of a last minute rewrite converting the database from persistant storage to an in memory solution.
